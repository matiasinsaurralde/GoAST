Go AST
======

A tool to produce a serialized (pre-order traversal with child counts) AST of any Go source file.

This readme badly needs to be updated with actual information till then, a pretty picture!

Example
=======

Here is an example AST:

It was generated from:

https://github.com/timtadh/GoAST/blob/master/tests/fib/fib.go.t


Status
======

It works, but there is no documentation and the API is not finalized (the reason for the lack of
documentation).
